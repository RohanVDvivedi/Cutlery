Tasks picked

 * implement a custom optimized version of function ffs() for bitmap, to not rely on the string.h

Competely new datastructure tasks (*future)

RANGE QUERY ON INT/UINT ARRAY DATASTRUCTURE tasks
 * use value_arraylist for below functionality and implement their iterative approaches only
 * access methods must be insert, update, find_range
 * implement segment tree => for min, max, sum, product(multiplication), bitwise-and, bitwise-or, bitwise-xor, lcm and hcf
 * implement fenwick tree => for addition, product(multiplication), bitwise-xor => the functions for which their inverse exists
 * implement sparse table => max, min, lcm, hcf => the functions for which f(a,b,c,d,e) = f(f(a,b,c), f(b,c,d,e))
