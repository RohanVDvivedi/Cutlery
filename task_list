LATER

 * build a cutlery specific memory allocator interface, that is required to be passed to datastructures that need memory management like the array and (hashmap, stack, queue and heap) [dev branch : memory_allocator_interface]
 * provide standard graph implementation interface (a structure to describe access methods to graphs), and use this access methods to develop and provide graph algorithms. The implementation must be agnostic of the structural implementation of the graphs. It must offcourse support node-pointer-based, adjacency-list-based, adjacency-matrix-based, incidence-matrix-based, edge list, etc all graphical representations must be supported. (* very far in the future) [dev branch : graph_interface]
 * provide a very simple trie data structure, to store groups of dstring. (* very far in the future)

FUTURE

 [dev branch : print_implementations]
  * convert all print functions to dstring based serializers using append_to_dstring_formatted() function
  * trim function to trim n characters from front or back in dstring
  * allow all print functions to serialize in debug and non debug modes

 * imlement custom memory_move function, which must be memory overlap/overwrite safe (using reverse iteration) and should perform a processor word transfer as alignment matches with the processor word size (instead of byte transfer to increase efficiency) [dev branch : memory_move_implementation]
