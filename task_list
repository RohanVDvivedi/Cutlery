 * decrease one variable in queue from three
 * make linkedlist as circular doubly list, linkedlist only stores head to the list, linkedlist->head->prev = tail (of linkedlist), similarly linkedlist->head->prev->next (i.e. tail->next) = head (of linkedlist), this will help us to reduce 1 variable from the linkedlist, and help us in making the linkedlist compatible to both singly_list and double_list
 * provide support for linkedlist type (SINGLY_LIST or DOUBLY_LIST), add a enum to be passed while creating the linkedlist. the methods which can not be implemented for singly list, mark to always return NULL or error

 * add implementation for a singly linkedlist

 * store only one instance to linkedlist or bst in the hashmap across all the buckets (*future feature)
 * change that linkedlist to a singly linkedlist, in the hashmap (*future feature)
