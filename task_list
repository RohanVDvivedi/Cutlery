 * hashmap needs a revamp
 * store only one instance to linkedlist or bst in the hashmap across all the buckets
 * change that linkedlist to a singly linkedlist, in the hashmap
 * hashmap closed implementations like the linkedlist or bst managed buckets need a way to protect them at bucket level, this can be of enormous importance in implementing caching hashtables (in single server or distributed servers) which need immense paralellism
