LATER

 * integrate memory allocator interface with Cutlery datastructures that need memory management like the array and (hashmap, stack, queue and heap) [dev branch : memory_allocator_interface]
 * integrate memory_move function and check correctness
 * implement more case - inclusive int transfer for it [dev branch : memory_move_implementation]

 * use graph descriptor interface to build graph algorithms [dev branch : graph_interface]like :
       * dfs (iterative only with Cutlery stack)
       * bfs (iterative only with Cutlery queue)
       * bellmanford
       * dijkstra
       * floydwarshall
       * Astar
       * minimum spanning tree
        etc (more will be added)

 * provide a very simple trie data structure, to store groups of dstring. (* very far in the future)

 * [dev branch : print_implementations]
  * convert all print functions to dstring based serializers using append_to_dstring_formatted() function
  * trim function to trim n characters from front or back in dstring
  * allow all print functions to serialize in debug and non debug modes
