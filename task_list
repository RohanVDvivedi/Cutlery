 STAGE - 2
 * implement arraylist, define queue and stack as extensions to arraylist (such that they are using arraylist underneath), write calls of print, expand and shrink an arraylist (and heap aswell)

 STAGE - 3 (dependent on STAGE - 2) (just start these implementation and stage 3 is completed, since covering all graph implementations will take a long time, so start trie implementation alongside this task)
 * use graph descriptor interface to build graph algorithms like :
    each of these graph functions take a memory_allocator to allocate memory for its own internal structures
    each of these functions must also take an array/queue/stack that will contain the result
    they also take a, node that we need to find and a compare function that returns zero when the match succeeds
       * dfs (iterative only with Cutlery stack)
       * bfs (iterative only with Cutlery queue)
       * bellmanford
       * dijkstra
       * floydwarshall
       * A*-star
       * minimum spanning tree
        etc (more will be added)

 STAGE - 4 (dependent on STAGE - 1, 2, 3(to start to conceptualize the memory allocation) )
 * need a context for memory allocator interface
 * simplify memory allocator interface too complex for a noobie
 * implement a stdlib memory_allocator for cutlery specific datastructures
 * integrate memory_allocator and memory_move with other Cutlery datastructures that need memory management like the array and (hashmap, stack, queue and heap)
 * use a global memory allocator for dstring, that can be set by someone

 STAGE - 5 (dependent on STAGE - 4, need strong memory management model for new datastructures)
 * provide a very simple trie data structure, to store of dstring* vs void*. (* very far in the future)

 STAGE - 6
 * convert all print functions to dstring based serializers using append_to_dstring_formatted() function
 * allow all print functions to serialize in debug and non debug modes
