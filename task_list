 * remove unnecessary dependencies from headers
 * remove dependencies from stdio and stdlib (*future feature)

 * remove complex node swap method call from bst remove function, keep the method but since this can be done in easier way with lesser operation so do it

 * add dstring based slices, this helps in further develop lexers on top of that
 * convert all print functions to dstring based serializers

 * allow all print functions to serialize in debug and non debug modes
